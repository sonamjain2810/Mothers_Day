    " “I want to live my life in such a way that when I get out of bed in the morning, the devil says, “aw shit, he’s up!” — Steve Maraboli",
    " “Look out of the window and take in the brightness from the sun. Forget the clouds and shadows of doubt and fear. Life awaits you in all its fullness; it’s another beautiful day. Good Morning!” — Ron Manchester"
